# Autonomous-Alcohol Detection System-using-mq2-555timer
Mini hardware project: Alcohol detection system using MQ2 gas sensor, 555 timer, BC547 and relay to trigger buzzer/LED alerts above a set threshold for vehicle and workplace safety.

Overview:It detects alcohol vapour and activates buzzer/LED using MQ2 + 555 timer + relay for safety applications (drunk‑driving prevention, workplace monitoring, etc.).​

Features:

Detects alcohol vapours using MQ2 sensor.​

Threshold‑based audio/visual alert with buzzer/LED and relay.​

Adjustable sensitivity via preset for different environments.​

Hardware Used:

MQ2 sensor, 555 timer IC, BC547 transistor, relay module, buzzer/LED, 7805 regulator, power supply.

 1. MQ2 Gas Sensor
•	Function: Detects gases such as alcohol, LPG, methane, carbon monoxide, and smoke.
•	Description: It provides an analog output corresponding to gas concentration. It is sensitive, inexpensive, and suitable for basic gas detection applications.

 2. 555 Timer IC
•	Function: Acts as a monostable multivibrator for signal processing.
•	Description: When triggered by the MQ2 sensor’s output, it generates a pulse to activate the alert circuit (LED/Buzzer). It helps in timing the output for a fixed duration.

 3. BC547 NPN Transistor
•	Function: Acts as a switch to control the relay or load.
•	Description: It amplifies the signal from the 555 timer and drives the relay or other alert devices.

 4. Relay Module (5V or 12V)
•	Function: Controls high-power devices like buzzers or external alarms.
•	Description: It acts as an electronically operated switch that turns ON/OFF external circuits based on the signal from the transistor.

 5. Buzzer / LED
•	Function: Provides audio or visual indication when alcohol is detected.
•	Description: A buzzer produces sound for immediate alert, while an LED provides a visual cue.

 6. Preset (Variable Resistor / Potentiometer)
•	Function: Adjusts the sensitivity of the sensor circuit.
•	Description: Allows calibration of the system to detect specific alcohol levels as per requirement.

 7. Resistors and Capacitors
•	Function: Used for timing and voltage regulation.
•	Description: Essential for building the 555 timer circuit and stabilizing the signal flow.

 8. Diode (e.g., 1N4007)
•	Function: Protects the circuit from back EMF generated by the relay coil.
•	Description: Ensures the safety of the transistor and other sensitive components.

9. Power Supply (5V or 12V Battery/Adapter)
•	Function: Powers the entire circuit.
•	Description: Can be a DC power source like a battery or regulated adapter based on component requirements.
